#A histogram is a diagram consisting of rectangles whose area is proportional to the frequency of a variable and whose width is equal to the class interval. If we want, we can make a histogram of player weights for the Master table.

```{r}
query<-"SELECT weight
FROM Master"

result<-sqldf(query)

ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(data=result,aes(x=weight),color="blue",fill="black",bins=50)+
  ggtitle("Body Weight Distribution for Baseball Players")
```
